# PSIApp

I have tried to finish most of the requirments. UI might not be good looking, but tried to maintain some visible options.
It will show you all the options for which you can see data, map shows the points on location for specfic region data.
When you click tab button, it will show you national data in floating view and when you click pin on map it should show region data.

Known Issues -
Map delegate not working for some reason.
